 👋 Hi there! I'm Ranush Mithila!
 </h1>

🎓 Currently pursuing dual degrees in Cyber Security at SLIIT and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Moratuwa, I bring a unique, dual-disciplinary perspective to the world of technology.

💻 With hands-on experience in hacking, Linux, web security, and Android app penetration testing, I'm passionate about solving complex security problems efficiently. 💪 My bug bounty exploits for high-profile companies like Helakuru, Payhere, and Bugzero have provided me with a comprehensive understanding of system security and its potential loopholes.

🚀 Beyond technical skills, I possess proven leadership and project management abilities, excelling in collaborative team environments. 🌟 My diverse educational background and practical experience make me a well-rounded candidate for dynamic, solution-oriented roles in the tech industry.

🔭 I'm particularly interested in opportunities in SOC, VAPT, Cloud, and networking domains. Let's connect and make a difference together!
