 Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 </h1>

I am an undergraduate student pursuing dual degrees in Cyber Security at SLIIT and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Moratuwa. This unique combination of disciplines allows me to bring a diverse perspective to any tech-related role.

With a strong focus on Cyber Security, I possess hands-on experience in various areas such as hacking, Linux, web security, and Android app penetration testing. This practical knowledge enables me to effectively analyze and solve complex security problems. I have actively participated in bug bounties for renowned companies including Helakuru, Payhere, and Bugzero, further enhancing my understanding of system security and identifying potential vulnerabilities.

Beyond my technical skills, I also possess proven leadership and project management abilities, thriving in collaborative team environments. Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently demonstrated the ability to effectively coordinate and deliver successful projects.

My diverse educational background and practical experience make me a well-rounded candidate for dynamic, solution-oriented roles within the technology sector. I am particularly interested in opportunities in SOC (Security Operations Center), VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing), GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance), Cloud, and networking domains.

I am excited about leveraging my skills and knowledge to contribute to cutting-edge projects and drive advancements in the field of technology.
